A very short note on loss choices for signal-reconstruction models (e.g., transformer autoencoders for MIMO radar). Two compact, complementary objectives that I often use are the time-domain MSE and a frequency-domain (PSD) consistency term.

**Mean squared error (MSE)** — measures sample-wise reconstruction fidelity:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{MSE}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\|x_n - \hat{x}_n\|_2^2,
$$
where \(x_n\) and \(\hat{x}_n\) are the target and reconstructed complex-IQ vectors (treated as real pairs).

**PSD consistency loss** — encourages the model to match spectral magnitude:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{PSD}} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\big( |\mathrm{FFT}(x_n)[k]| - |\mathrm{FFT}(\hat{x}_n)[k]|\big)^2.
$$

Combine them with a weighting factor \(\lambda\):
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{MSE}} + \lambda\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{PSD}}.
$$

*Implementation note:* normalize per-channel (zero mean, unit variance) before computing losses and tune \(\lambda\) so PSD and MSE magnitudes are comparable. This small hybrid loss often preserves both time-domain waveform fidelity and spectral shape — useful when downstream radar/communication metrics (EVM, detection) are sensitive to spectral distortions.
