**Abstract:**  
This paper presents an autonomous surveillance system for real-time violence detection using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture. Leveraging **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight deep neural network optimized for resource-constrained environments, the proposed model efficiently extracts features and classifies violent activities in video streams. Designed for high-performance applications with minimal computational requirements, the system achieved an impressive **99% accuracy** on benchmark datasets, ensuring timely alerts to authorities and enhancing the effectiveness of automated security monitoring.
