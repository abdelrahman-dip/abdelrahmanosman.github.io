**Abstract:**  
This paper introduces a novel **Transformer Autoencoder (TAE)** for signal reconstruction in MIMO radar systems, specifically addressing **random antenna dropout** and challenging **multi-target environments**. Our TAE leverages a **Transformer encoder with self-attention mechanisms** to effectively capture temporal dependencies across radar pulses, enabling robust performance under **low-SNR conditions**.  

The modelâ€™s reconstruction capabilities are validated on a comprehensive radar dataset, processing signals with **1 to 5 targets** and simulating real-world impairments through random antenna dropout and noise. Compared to traditional methods like **interpolation** and **compressed sensing**, our approach significantly improves reconstruction accuracy and signal quality, particularly at higher dropout rates.  

This research demonstrates the TAEâ€™s potential for enhanced performance in dynamic and noisy real-world MIMO radar applications.  

**Keywords:** Transformer Autoencoder, self-attention mechanisms, MIMO radar, signal reconstruction, antenna dropout, low-SNR processing, multi-target environments, deep learning for radar
