I am a Master's student in Electronic Science and Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), July 2024 – July 2026 (expected). I hold a B.E. in Electronics and Communication from Delhi Technological University. My work combines practical RF/RFIC front-end design (ADS/Cadence) with advanced signal-processing and machine-learning techniques.

### Research interests
- Digital Predistortion (DPD) for power amplifier linearization (CNN–LSTM, hypernetworks)  
- RF & microwave system and RFIC front-end design  
- Adaptive signal processing and robust estimation  
- Radar signal processing (MIMO, antenna dropout, reconstruction)  
- AI-driven techniques for next-generation wireless systems
