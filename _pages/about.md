I am a Master's student majoring in Electronic Science and Engineering at the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**, July 2024 – July 2026 (expected). I hold a B.E. in Electronics and Communication from Delhi Technological University (DTU). My work combines RFIC design (ADS/Cadence) with signal-processing and machine-learning techniques.

### Research interests
- Digital Predistortion (DPD) for power amplifier linearization
- RFIC front-end design
